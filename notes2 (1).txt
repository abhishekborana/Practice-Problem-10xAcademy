- Sorting is a process of arranging or rearranging elements in a meaningful order so that we can analyze it
- There are multiple to implement sorting on a list of items, the sorting algorithm that will be optimal depends upon the kind of data we are sorting
- In insertion sort we have two parts to the array: sorted, other is unsorted
- We go through the list of elements and we compare it with the sorted part of the array and we place it at the correct position

Algorithm: (Ascending order)
1. It is the 1st element, then assume that it is sorted
2. Pick the next element
3. Compare the element with the sorted part of the list, i.e the elements on the left
4. Shift all the elements in the sorted part that are greater than the current element
5. Insert the value
6. Repeat steps 2 - 5 for each element in the list
